This detects location from browser if shared, or via Akamai edge server if used, then flows through several fallbacks to get best location possible. 

If all else fails, uses best IP provided. 

Using this, along with integration with Google Maps API, an address of the visitor can be obtained. 

Based on address, routes the visitor to the correct branch office.
